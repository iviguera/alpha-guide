      <title>Talk to Career Agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the introductory tutorial, there are also a handful of Career Agents
which will provide you with various missions introducing you to a particular kind of
gameplay. These missions are an excellent way to explore some of the possibilities in
EVE while also acquiring some extra ISK and ship hulls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices tip&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to open the Career Agents window again (e.g. because you closed it),
press &lt;kbd&gt;F12&lt;/kbd&gt; to open the &amp;lsquo;Help&amp;rsquo; window and click the &amp;lsquo;Show Career Agents&amp;rsquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you complete all of the career agent mission chains now. The pages in
this section will provide brief descriptions of what each chain will teach you and the
rewards you will receive for completing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices note&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read all mission text carefully - some objectives are easily missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission chain is &lt;strong&gt;Balancing the Books&lt;/strong&gt;. Its 10 missions will have you doing
salvaging, hacking, mining, and a bit of running around delivering things to agents
in different systems. These are ways that you can make money in EVE without having
to use your weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, there&amp;rsquo;s a video guide to the missions that begins
here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RtjAYs8spU&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RtjAYs8spU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the video guide was made in 2015, the older interfaces may look a bit
different from what you see now, but the general steps to complete the mission
will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you complete the chain, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a couple of new ships, some skill books,
some modules, and a good chunk of ISK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-stumbling-blocks&#34;&gt;Common Stumbling Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 2 of 10, the Black Box will be ejected into a Cargo Container
when you destroy the last pirate.  Remember to pick it up before returning to station.
If you forgot, you can warp back to the mission site within 2 hours and it will still be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 3 of 10, the Veldspar must be mined in the mission site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 6 of 10, the Tracking Computer I is most easily acquired from the Market.
See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/market/&#34;&gt;Use the Market&lt;/a&gt; section if you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 9 of 10, you can use &lt;code&gt;1MN Afterburner I&lt;/code&gt; modules acquired from other Career Agent
missions or from the Market.  Make sure they are Repackaged (right-click -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Repackage&amp;rdquo;)
or the agent will not accept them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 10 of 10, the manufacturing process will take substantial time;
you can do other things (such as other career agent missions) while the build is in progress.
Some of the minerals required may be most easily sourced through the Market rather than via mining.
You can also just buy the ammunition off the market, despite what the agent says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission chain walks you through how to use the scanning interfaces
in EVE. Scanning lets you locate things like wormholes, data and relic sites
to hack, and even other players&amp;rsquo; ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanning interfaces can be a little hard to understand without seeing
them in operation. Thankfully, EVE has a set of built-in video tutorials
for how to use the scanning interfaces. To view them, press F12 to open
the &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; window, then select the &amp;ldquo;Tutorial Videos&amp;rdquo; tab. Scroll down to
the &amp;ldquo;Exploration&amp;rdquo; subsection (click to expand it). Then watch the following
videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scanning (1 of 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scanning (2 of 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacking Data and Relic sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other videos are also interesting, but aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant to this particular
mission chain - feel free to watch them when you have the time and interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you complete the chain, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a couple of new ships (including one
specifically designed for exploration), some skill books, some modules,
and a good chunk of ISK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-stumbling-blocks&#34;&gt;Common Stumbling Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On mission 3 of 5, you&amp;rsquo;ll be required to find a &amp;ldquo;Data Site&amp;rdquo;.
This is a Cosmic Signature, and you will not be able to warp to it without using scanner probes.
Review the Scanning (2 or 3) video to learn how to use these probes to find the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On mission 5 of 5, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a Passkey with you to be able to enter the final site.
It&amp;rsquo;s provided to you when you begin the mission; remember to put it in your cargohold before you undock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Industry Agent</title>
      <link>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/career-agents/industry/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This chain is &lt;strong&gt;Making Mountains of Molehills&lt;/strong&gt;. Its 10 missions focus
on how to produce new items in EVE from scratch: mining raw materials
and then building modules, charges (ammo), and ships from those materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble figuring out how to use the industry interface,
you can watch the tutorial videos provided in-game. Press F12 to open the
&amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; window, then click the &amp;ldquo;Tutorial Videos&amp;rdquo; tab. Scroll down to the
&amp;ldquo;Industry&amp;rdquo; section and watch the &amp;ldquo;Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you complete the chain, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a couple of new ships, some skill
books, some modules, and a good chunk of isk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-stumbling-blocks&#34;&gt;Common Stumbling Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 2 of 10, note that the Veldspar must be in the station&amp;rsquo;s Item Hangar,
not your ship&amp;rsquo;s Cargo Hold, before it can be Reprocessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 3 of 10, the &lt;code&gt;1MN Civilian Afterburner I Blueprint&lt;/code&gt; must be purchased from the Market.
It should cost 20,000 ISK.  See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/market/&#34;&gt;Use the Market&lt;/a&gt; section if you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 4 of 10, note that ore must be mined from the mission site to complete all mission objectives.
Using ore mined from other asteroid belts, or previous mission steps, won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to finish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 9 of 10, make sure that you have both a mining laser and a weapon fit to your ship.
Having only one or the other will be insufficient to complete the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 10 of 10, the minerals you will need come from a variety of different ores.
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Asteroids_and_Ore#Asteroid_distribution&#34;&gt;EVE University page on Asteroids and Ore&lt;/a&gt; for the locations of the appropriate ores.  Note that Zydrine cannot be obtained from high-security asteroids, except in randomly-spawning Ore anomalies.  It may be quickest and easiest to simply buy the rarer minerals from the Market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Military Agents</title>
      <link>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/career-agents/military/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:59:33 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are actually two military career agents - the regular Military Agent and the Advanced Military Agent.
We recommend doing both chains - first the regular agent, then the advanced agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;military-agent&#34;&gt;Military Agent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regular Military Agent focuses on teaching you the basics of PvE combat missions
in the chain &lt;strong&gt;Cash Flow for Capsuleers&lt;/strong&gt;. Missions like these are one of the main
ways for making ISK in EVE via PvE combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck along the way, there&amp;rsquo;s a video guide to the missions that begins here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic8U2sX7yd4&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic8U2sX7yd4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the video guide was made in 2014, the older interfaces may look a bit different
from what you see now, but the general steps to complete the mission will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you complete this chain, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn a couple of new ships, some skill books, some
modules, and a good chunk of isk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-stumbling-blocks&#34;&gt;Common Stumbling Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 3 of 10, the Secret Documents will appear in a Cargo Container after you
kill the last pirate.  Make sure to loot them before you dock.  If you forgot them,
you can return to the Mission location for up to two hours afterwards, and they will still be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 4 of 10, pay attention to your Local chat channel to see when you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 5 of 10, you need to destroy the pirate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 9 of 10, the Narcotics Warehouse may not appear on your overview.
It is one of the man-made structures around the large asteroid.
Search for it visually, and destroy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-military-agent&#34;&gt;Advanced Military Agent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Military Agent focuses on teaching you some of the concepts typically
involved in PvP combat (though the agent&amp;rsquo;s missions do not actually involve PvP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices warning&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;This mission chain involves your ship exploding. Leave your valuable items behind in station,
and read all mission text carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We recommend following the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Advanced_Military_Career_Funnel_Chain&#34;&gt;UniWiki Advanced Military chain guide&lt;/a&gt; to complete
this mission chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you complete this chain, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn some new ships (including a Destroyer),
some skill books, some modules, and a decent chunk of ISK. At the end you&amp;rsquo;ll also
be given a Letter item which you can use to join a Faction Warfare NPC corporation
if you decide that you want to take part in Faction Warfare. Don&amp;rsquo;t rush off to do
that quite yet though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;common-stumbling-blocks-1&#34;&gt;Common Stumbling Blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 2 of 10, &lt;strong&gt;your ship will be destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;.  You must use a Frigate.
It does not have to be the one provided to you by the Mission Agent - use whichever you like least.
The ship does not require any modules fit to complete the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 3 of 10, note that you need to Warp Disrupt the pirate, not destroy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 5 of 10, &lt;strong&gt;your ship will be destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can use any ship;
it must be capable of defeating at least one moderately-tough pirate.
The mission is completable in a properly-fit Corvette, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 8 of 10, wait for the Fleet Commander&amp;rsquo;s orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 9 of 10, note that you must use a Civilian Stasis Webifier like the one provided.
You may have acquired some Stasis Webifier Is from other missions or the Market,
but they will not properly complete the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mission 10 of 10, &lt;strong&gt;your ship will be unable to warp out&lt;/strong&gt; unless and until you are victorious.
Make sure your ship is properly fit for battle before you begin.
If you&amp;rsquo;re unable to destroy the pirate, but the pirate is unable to destroy you,
you can right-click your capacitor and &amp;ldquo;Self Destruct&amp;rdquo; to end the stalemate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
