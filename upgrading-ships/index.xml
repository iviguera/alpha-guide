      <description>&lt;p&gt;By this point you should have the resources to move on from the basic rookie ship to
something better. The ships you have available will depend on your race, so choose
the proper link below to go to the subsection appropriate for you:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of your Career Agent missions,
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frigates&#34;&gt;Frigates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frigates are some of the fastest and smallest ships in New Eden.
This makes them very difficult for larger ships to hit.
Their guns also track very quickly, allowing them to effectively fight other frigates.
However, their raw defensive and offensive power is relatively weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;executioner&#34;&gt;Executioner&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Executioner is the Amarr fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules
also makes it good at &amp;ldquo;tackling&amp;rdquo; enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/executioner/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Executioner.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;tormentor&#34;&gt;Tormentor&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tormentor is the Amarr heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its three energy turrets,
and is otherwise well-rounded, with decent defenses,
sufficient midslots to offer some utility, and a moderate drone bay.
However, it is somewhat slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/tormentor/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Tormentor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;punisher&#34;&gt;Punisher&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Punisher is the Amarr heavy combat frigate.
It is incredibly durable, and has potent firepower.
However, it is quite slow, and its limited midslots limit its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/punisher/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Punisher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;magnate&#34;&gt;Magnate&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magnate is the Amarr exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/magnate/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Magnate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;inquisitor&#34;&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inquisitor is the Amarr logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules,
allowing it to &amp;ldquo;heal&amp;rdquo; allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Inquisitor for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;crucifier&#34;&gt;Crucifier&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crucifier is the Amarr electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of weapon disruptor modules,
allowing it to degrade its enemies&amp;rsquo; range and accuracy while staying safely out of range itself.
However, it is extremely fragile, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Crucifier for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;venture&#34;&gt;Venture&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/venture/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;destroyers&#34;&gt;Destroyers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destroyers are designed as a counter to frigates.
They are &amp;ldquo;glass cannons&amp;rdquo; - they get large numbers of frigate-class guns,
with substantial enhancements to their range and tracking,
making them able to swat frigates out of the sky with ease.
However,  their defenses are little stronger than a frigate&amp;rsquo;s,
and their larger size and slower speed makes them less able to avoid the fire
of larger ships.  They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;coercer&#34;&gt;Coercer&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coercer is one of the Amarr destroyers, focusing on laser turrets.
With the maximum of eight hardpoints for energy weapons,
and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy,
it will quickly destroy any smaller enemies that come near it.
However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its lasers&amp;rsquo; damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/coercer/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Coercer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;dragoon&#34;&gt;Dragoon&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragoon is the other Amarr destroyer, focusing on drones and energy neutralization.
It has only three hardpoints for each of turrets and launchers,
but can field a full flight of five light drones and two more flights in reserve,
with bonuses to their damage and speed.
It also gains bonuses to the range of Energy Neutralizers, used to directly attack
enemies&amp;rsquo; capacitors in PvP.
Its drones give it long reach, but its maximum damage output is low
and its neutralizer bonuses are not useful in PvE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/dragoon/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Dragoon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cruisers&#34;&gt;Cruisers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden.  With comfortable slot layouts,
decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price,
they&amp;rsquo;re the standard by which other ships are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruiser fittings will not be provided in this guide.  By the time you&amp;rsquo;re getting
into a cruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/reference/fitting/&#34;&gt;Fitting&lt;/a&gt; if you need some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;battlecruisers&#34;&gt;Battlecruisers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates:
much more heavily armed, but substantially slower.  Battlecruisers are
also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gnosis is the only battlecruiser available to Alpha clones.
It is available to all races, and offers moderate bonuses to
nearly all weapons systems and defenses while excelling in none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gnosis fitting will not be provided in this guide. By the time you&amp;rsquo;re getting
into a battlecruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/reference/fitting/&#34;&gt;Fitting&lt;/a&gt; if you need some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;industrials&#34;&gt;Industrials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden.
They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they&amp;rsquo;re armed at all.
They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist,
or even a combat pilot restocking on gear or moving locations,
but are borderline useless in combat and a favorite target of player pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;sigil&#34;&gt;Sigil&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sigil is one of the Amarr industrials.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/amarr/sigil/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Sigil.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Condor is the Caldari fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules
also makes it good at &amp;ldquo;tackling&amp;rdquo; enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;kestrel&#34;&gt;Kestrel&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kestrel is the Caldari heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its four missile launchers,
allowing it to deal substantial damage in close with rockets or lob light missiles from extreme range.
Its good number of midslots also allow it decent defenses or good utility.
However, it is somewhat slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/caldari/kestrel/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Kestrel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;merlin&#34;&gt;Merlin&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merlin is the Caldari heavy combat frigate.
It has very powerful shields, and decent firepower and flexibility.
However, it is rather slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/caldari/merlin/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Merlin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;heron&#34;&gt;Heron&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heron is the Caldari exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/caldari/heron/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Heron.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;bantam&#34;&gt;Bantam&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bantam is the Caldari logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote shield booster modules,
allowing it to &amp;ldquo;heal&amp;rdquo; allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Bantam for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;griffin&#34;&gt;Griffin&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Griffin is the Caldari electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of ECM jammer modules,
allowing it to render enemies unable to lock targets
and thus helpless to fight back against attackers.
However, it is extremely fragile and has little direct combat capability,
and is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Griffin for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;venture&#34;&gt;Venture&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.

of larger ships.  They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;cormorant&#34;&gt;Cormorant&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cormorant is one of the Caldari destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets.
Its seven hardpoints for hybrid weapons have enhanced accuracy and
massive boosts to their range,
allowing it to reach out and destroy smaller enemies at extreme distance.
However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons&amp;rsquo; damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/caldari/cormorant/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Cormorant.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;corax&#34;&gt;Corax&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Corax is the other Caldari destroyer, focusing on missiles.
It has seven launcher hardpoints, and a bonus to missile range and damage application,
and comes with a comfortable four midslots, allowing it to mount a strong shield tank.
However, it is slow, and its poor CPU and powergrid make it difficult to fit properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;badger&#34;&gt;Badger&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Badger is one of the Caldari industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atron is the Gallente fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules
also makes it good at &amp;ldquo;tackling&amp;rdquo; enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;tristan&#34;&gt;Tristan&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tristan is the Gallente heavy attack frigate.
As a drone platform, it is unrivalled among tech one frigates,
capable of fielding a full flight of five light drones, with three spares
in its spacious drone bay.  It is also fairly well-rounded otherwise,
with moderate damage output from its turrets and decent speed and utility options.
However, it is somewhat lightly defended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/tristan/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Tristan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;incursus&#34;&gt;Incursus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incursus is the Gallente heavy combat frigate.
Its bonuses to armor repairers let it shrug off a great deal of incoming damage,
and it has good firepower and decent utility options.
However, it is fairly slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/incursus/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Incursus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;imicus&#34;&gt;Imicus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Imicus is the Gallente exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/imicus/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Imicus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;navitas&#34;&gt;Navitas&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navitas is the Gallente logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules,
allowing it to &amp;ldquo;heal&amp;rdquo; allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Navitas for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;maulus&#34;&gt;Maulus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maulus is the Gallente electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of sensor dampener modules,
allowing it to interfere with the locking speed and range of its enemies&amp;rsquo; sensors from long range.
However, it is extremely fragile, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Maulus for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;venture&#34;&gt;Venture&lt;/h5&gt;

of larger ships.  They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;catalyst&#34;&gt;Catalyst&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Catalyst is one of the Gallente destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets.
With the maximum of eight hardpoints for hybrid weapons,
and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy,
it will quickly destroy any smaller enemies that come within range of its guns.
However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons&amp;rsquo; damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/catalyst/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Catalyst.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;algos&#34;&gt;Algos&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Algos is the other Gallente destroyer, focusing on drones.
It gets only five turret hardpoints, few for a destroyer,
but has the drone bandwidth to begin mixing in medium drones
into its flights, with room in its bay for a spare flight of lights.
It also has moderate speed and defenses, and works well with shield-tanking modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/algos/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Algos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cruisers&#34;&gt;Cruisers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden.  With comfortable slot layouts,
decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price,
they&amp;rsquo;re the standard by which other ships are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruiser fittings will not be provided in this guide.  By the time you&amp;rsquo;re getting
into a cruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/reference/fitting/&#34;&gt;Fitting&lt;/a&gt; if you need some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;battlecruisers&#34;&gt;Battlecruisers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates:
much more heavily armed, but substantially slower.  Battlecruisers are
also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gnosis is the only battlecruiser available to Alpha clones.
It is available to all races, and offers moderate bonuses to
nearly all weapons systems and defenses while excelling in none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gnosis fitting will not be provided in this guide. By the time you&amp;rsquo;re getting
into a battlecruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/reference/fitting/&#34;&gt;Fitting&lt;/a&gt; if you need some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;industrials&#34;&gt;Industrials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden.
They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they&amp;rsquo;re armed at all.
They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist,
or even a combat pilot restocking on gear or moving locations,
but are borderline useless in combat and a favorite target of player pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;nereus&#34;&gt;Nereus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nereus is one of the Gallente industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/nereus/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Nereus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Minmatar Ships</title>
      <link>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:56:39 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of your Career Agent missions,
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frigates&#34;&gt;Frigates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frigates are some of the fastest and smallest ships in New Eden.
This makes them very difficult for larger ships to hit.
Their guns also track very quickly, allowing them to effectively fight other frigates.
However, their raw defensive and offensive power is relatively weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;slasher&#34;&gt;Slasher&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slasher is the Minmatar fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules
also makes it good at &amp;ldquo;tackling&amp;rdquo; enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/slasher/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Slasher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;rifter&#34;&gt;Rifter&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rifter is the Minmatar heavy attack frigate.
It gets substantial bonuses to its projectile turrets,
allowing it to deal good damage.  It is otherwise well-rounded,
with decent speed and defenses, and its slot layout allows it a high degree of flexibility.
However, that flexibility means it does not excel strongly in any one aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/rifter/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Rifter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;breacher&#34;&gt;Breacher&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Breacher is the Minmatar heavy combat frigate.
Its bonuses to shield boosters allow it to shrug off a great deal of incoming damage,
it can deal acceptable damage with its rocket launchers, and it has good speed.
However, its relatively weak powergrid can make it difficult to fit well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/breacher/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Breacher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;probe&#34;&gt;Probe&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Probe is the Minmatar exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/probe/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Probe.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;burst&#34;&gt;Burst&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Burst is the Minmatar logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote shield booster modules,
allowing it to &amp;ldquo;heal&amp;rdquo; allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Bantam for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;vigil&#34;&gt;Vigil&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vigil is the Minmatar electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of target painter modules,
allowing it to render enemies substantially easier for its allies to hit.
However, it is extremely fragile and has little direct combat capability,
and is not very useful to a solo pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Vigil for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;venture&#34;&gt;Venture&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/venture/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;destroyers&#34;&gt;Destroyers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destroyers are designed as a counter to frigates.
They are &amp;ldquo;glass cannons&amp;rdquo; - they get large numbers of frigate-class guns,
with substantial enhancements to their range and tracking,
making them able to swat frigates out of the sky with ease.
However,  their defenses are little stronger than a frigate&amp;rsquo;s,
and their larger size and slower speed makes them less able to avoid the fire
of larger ships.  They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;thrasher&#34;&gt;Thrasher&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thrasher is one of the Minmatar destroyers, focusing on projectile turrets.
Its seven hardpoints for projectile weapons have enhanced accuracy, damage and range,
giving it a powerful offensive punch.
It is relatively fast and well-defended for a destroyer, but still slow compared to frigates,
and its larger size makes it easily targeted and destroyed by larger ships.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons&amp;rsquo; damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/thrasher/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Thrasher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;talwar&#34;&gt;Talwar&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Talwar is the other Minmatar destroyer, focusing on missiles.
Its seven missile launchers get a substantial bonus to their range,
and it mitigates the signature penalty of Microwarpdrives,
allowing it to use them to avoid incoming fire as if they were Afterburners.
It is also relatively fast for a destroyer.
This makes it a natural fit for long-range, high-speed &amp;ldquo;kiting&amp;rdquo; tactics with light missiles.
However, its damage output is relatively low, and it is rather fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/minmatar/talwar/&#34;&gt;Here is a recommended fit for the Talwar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cruisers&#34;&gt;Cruisers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden.  With comfortable slot layouts,
decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price,
they&amp;rsquo;re the standard by which other ships are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates:
much more heavily armed, but substantially slower.  Battlecruisers are
also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gnosis is the only battlecruiser available to Alpha clones.

&lt;p&gt;Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden.
They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they&amp;rsquo;re armed at all.
They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist,

long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

      <link>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/atron/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:33:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://iviguera.github.io/alpha-guide/upgrading-ships/gallente/atron/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118501/svg/118501-alpha-clone---starter-atron.svg?privatetoken=7015883971993010176&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118501/7015883971993010176&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Starter Atron on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapons&#34;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atron uses 3 &lt;code&gt;Light Ion Blaster I&lt;/code&gt; turrets.
Blasters are the &amp;ldquo;short-ranged&amp;rdquo; hybrid system, with some of the highest damage output
and best tracking against small targets in the game.  In exchange, they are the shortest-ranged
weapon system in the game, being all but useless outside of point-blank range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blasters are loaded with &lt;code&gt;Antimatter Charge S&lt;/code&gt; ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
As blasters require you to be in knife-fighting range anyway,
losing a few more meters will hardly be noticed,
and the extra damage will be appreciated once you come to grips with your foe.
You should keep about 2000 spare rounds in your cargohold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this fit uses a &lt;code&gt;Magnetic Field Stabilizer I&lt;/code&gt; in one of its low slots.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its blasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defenses&#34;&gt;Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship uses a &lt;code&gt;Small Armor Repairer I&lt;/code&gt; in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also fits a &lt;code&gt;Damage Control I&lt;/code&gt; in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility&#34;&gt;Utility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;1MN Afterburner I&lt;/code&gt; provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Stasis Webifier I&lt;/code&gt; helps your projectiles apply their damage better, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Small Capacitor Booster I&lt;/code&gt; can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with
&lt;code&gt;Cap Booster 200&lt;/code&gt; bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rigs&#34;&gt;Rigs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed.
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starter fit does not use or require any rigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-fly&#34;&gt;How To Fly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 500m, applying your web to slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ship has high speed, but is relatively fragile.  Keep an eye on your hitpoints,
and consider warping out or pulling range from the enemy guns if your armor repairer
cannot keep up with incoming damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously.
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship&amp;rsquo;s base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you&amp;rsquo;re beginning to take structure damage, warp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-improvements&#34;&gt;Future Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend working towards the following improved fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118502/svg/118502-alpha-clone---improved-atron.svg?privatetoken=2111440561624842240&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118502/2111440561624842240&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Improved Atron on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapon Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hull Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit uses a &lt;code&gt;5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive&lt;/code&gt; rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run,
and causes a large increase to your ship&amp;rsquo;s signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the additional Powergrid requirement of the Microwarpdrive,
the improved fit adds a &lt;code&gt;Small Ancillary Current Router I&lt;/code&gt; rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit adds a &lt;code&gt;Small Anti-Explosive Pump I&lt;/code&gt; to patch up the weak point
in its armor&amp;rsquo;s resistances, and a &lt;code&gt;Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I&lt;/code&gt; to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of its armor repairer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every module has been improved to a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guns: 3x &lt;code&gt;Modal Light Ion Particle Accelerator I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web: &lt;code&gt;X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Injector: &lt;code&gt;Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armor Repairer: &lt;code&gt;Small &#39;Accommodation&#39; Vestment Reconstructor I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Control: &lt;code&gt;Damage Control II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Mod: &lt;code&gt;Magnetic Field Stabilizer II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118506/svg/118506-alpha-clone---starter-catalyst.svg?privatetoken=472855717238276096&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118506/472855717238276096&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Starter Catalyst on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapons&#34;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Catalyst uses 8 &lt;code&gt;125mm Railgun I&lt;/code&gt; turrets.
Railguns are the &amp;ldquo;long-ranged&amp;rdquo; hybrid system, with some of the longest firing ranges in the game,
compared to the extremely short-ranged Blasters.  In exchange, they deal less damage over time,
are harder to fit, and have very poor tracking against close-in targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The railguns are loaded with &lt;code&gt;Antimatter Charge S&lt;/code&gt; ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
The base range of your railguns will allow you to easily outrange your enemies
even with this short-ranged ammo, so more damage is always nice.
You should keep about 2500 spare rounds in your cargohold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this fit uses a &lt;code&gt;Magnetic Field Stabilizer I&lt;/code&gt; in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its railguns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defenses&#34;&gt;Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship uses a &lt;code&gt;Small Armor Repairer I&lt;/code&gt; in one of it low slots to repair incoming damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also fits a &lt;code&gt;Damage Control I&lt;/code&gt; to increase its resistance to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility&#34;&gt;Utility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;1MN Afterburner I&lt;/code&gt; provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Stasis Webifier I&lt;/code&gt; helps your projectiles apply their damage better, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay at the proper range from the slower enemies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rigs&#34;&gt;Rigs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed.
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Small Hybrid Collision Accelerator I&lt;/code&gt; rig will give your hybrid turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-fly&#34;&gt;How To Fly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you&amp;rsquo;re beginning to take structure damage, warp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-improvements&#34;&gt;Future Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend working towards the following improved fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118507/svg/118507-alpha-clone---improved-catalyst.svg?privatetoken=2896119769365217280&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118507/2896119769365217280&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Improved Catalyst on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapon Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hull Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit uses a &lt;code&gt;5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive&lt;/code&gt; rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run,
and causes a large increase to your ship&amp;rsquo;s signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit replaces the weapon rig with a &lt;code&gt;Small Anti-Explosive Pump I&lt;/code&gt;, to patch the weak point
in its armor&amp;rsquo;s resist profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also adds two &lt;code&gt;Small Capacitor Control Circuit I&lt;/code&gt; rigs, passively increasing its capacitor regeneration
and allowing the armor repairer to be run for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every module has been improved to a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guns: 8x &lt;code&gt;125mm Prototype Gauss Gun&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web: &lt;code&gt;X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Control: &lt;code&gt;Damage Control II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armor Repairer: &lt;code&gt;Small Armor Repairer II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Mod: &lt;code&gt;Magnetic Field Stabilizer II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118467/svg/118467-alpha-clone---starter-coercer.svg?privatetoken=4887651273651781632&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118467/4887651273651781632&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Starter Coercer on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapons&#34;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coercer uses 8 &lt;code&gt;Dual Light Beam Laser I&lt;/code&gt; turrets.
Beam lasers are the &amp;ldquo;long-ranged&amp;rdquo; laser system, dealing damage at longer ranges
than Pulse Lasers, but with worse tracking and slightly lower damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beam lasers are each loaded with a single &lt;code&gt;Multifrequency S&lt;/code&gt; crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy eight.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this fit uses a &lt;code&gt;Heat Sink I&lt;/code&gt; in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its lasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defenses&#34;&gt;Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship uses a &lt;code&gt;Small Armor Repairer I&lt;/code&gt; in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also fits a &lt;code&gt;Damage Control I&lt;/code&gt; in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility&#34;&gt;Utility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;1MN Afterburner I&lt;/code&gt; provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Small Capacitor Booster I&lt;/code&gt; can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with
&lt;code&gt;Cap Booster 200&lt;/code&gt; bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 30-40).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rigs&#34;&gt;Rigs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed.
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Small Energy Collision Accelerator I&lt;/code&gt; rig will give your energy turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Small Energy Burst Aerator I&lt;/code&gt; rig will give your energy turrets a quicker rate of fire,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-fly&#34;&gt;How To Fly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously.
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship&amp;rsquo;s base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you&amp;rsquo;re beginning to take structure damage, warp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-improvements&#34;&gt;Future Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapon Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Energy Grid Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coercer&amp;rsquo;s eight laser turrets make it extremely capacitor-hungry.
Its bonus to laser capacitor consumption means you can substantially improve your
capacitor life by training Amarr Destroyer to level III or IV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a &lt;code&gt;Cap Recharger II&lt;/code&gt;,
and replaces the rigs with three &lt;code&gt;Small Capacitor Control Circuit I&lt;/code&gt;, enhancing
its passive capacitor recharge.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every module has been improved to a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Propulsion: &lt;code&gt;1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Control: &lt;code&gt;Damage Control II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armor Repairer: &lt;code&gt;Small Armor Repairer II&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapons&#34;&gt;Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cormorant uses 7 &lt;code&gt;125mm Railgun I&lt;/code&gt; turrets.
Railguns are the &amp;ldquo;long-ranged&amp;rdquo; hybrid system, with some of the longest firing ranges in the game,

&lt;p&gt;This ship uses a &lt;code&gt;Medium Shield Booster I&lt;/code&gt; in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.
The capacitor consumption of this module is very high, so it should be used sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also fits a &lt;code&gt;Damage Control I&lt;/code&gt; to increase its resistance to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility&#34;&gt;Utility&lt;/h3&gt;

are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ship is fit with two &lt;code&gt;Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I&lt;/code&gt; rigs and one
&lt;code&gt;Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I&lt;/code&gt; rig, to improve its shields&amp;rsquo; resistance to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-fly&#34;&gt;How To Fly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m to 1000m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend working towards the following improved fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object type=&#34;image/svg+xml&#34; data=&#34;https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118480/svg/118480-alpha-clone---improved-cormorant.svg?privatetoken=988938429179887616&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118480/988938429179887616&#34;&gt;View Alpha Clone - Improved Cormorant on Osmium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapon Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hull Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level IV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Energy Grid Upgrades&lt;/code&gt; Level I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a &lt;code&gt;Cap Recharger II&lt;/code&gt;,
and replaces the Anti-Thermal and one of the Anti-EM rigs with two &lt;code&gt;Small Capacitor Control Circuit I&lt;/code&gt;, enhancing its passive capacitor recharge.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shield booster has been downsized from Medium to a &lt;code&gt;Small Shield Booster II&lt;/code&gt;.
This reduces the maximum &amp;ldquo;burst-tanking&amp;rdquo; power of its defense,
but allows the booster&amp;rsquo;s use to be sustained for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduced fitting cost allows the use of more powerful and longer-ranged guns,
increasing its effective range to about 15-20km.  You can play the improved fit as
more of a true sniper, hanging back out of range of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s return fire and
picking them off from afar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every module has been improved to a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
